# Spark Examples

This directory contains example applications demonstrating various features and capabilities of the Spark UI framework.

## Quick Start

All examples can be run using:

```bash
cargo run -p <example-name> --release

- Alignment options (start, center, end, stretch, space-between)
- Padding and margin controls
- Nested layouts and composition
- Responsive design patterns
- Gap/spacing controls

**Run:**
```bash
cargo run -p layout --release
```

**Features:**

### 4. Demo
**Path:** `examples/demo`
**Level:** Intermediate
**Topics:** Widgets library, Styling, Complex UI

A comprehensive demonstration of Spark's widget library and styling capabilities.

**What you'll learn:**
- All available widgets (buttons, text inputs, sliders, etc.)
- Widget styling and theming
- Form handling
- Complex UI composition

**Run:**
```bash
cargo run -p demo --release
```

---

### 5. Native Demo
**Path:** `examples/native-demo`
**Level:** Advanced
**Topics:** Native integration, Platform-specific widgets

Demonstrates integration with native platform widgets and platform-specific features.

**What you'll learn:**
- Native widget integration
- Platform-specific APIs
- Mixing Spark and native UI
- Platform capabilities

**Run:**
```bash
cargo run -p native-demo --release
```

- Performance optimization
- Accessibility features
- Theming and styling
- Event handling patterns
- Real-world UI patterns

**Run:**
```bash
cargo run -p kitchen-sink --release
```

**Features:**
- Tab-based navigation
- Multiple example sections:
  - Widget showcase
  - Layout patterns
  - Animation gallery
  - Form handling
  - Data visualization
  - Native integration
- Production-ready code patterns
- Accessibility best practices
- Performance optimizations

## Learning Path

We recommend exploring the examples in this order:

1. **Triangle** - Understand basic rendering
2. **Counter** - Learn state management and widgets
3. **Layout Gallery** - Master the layout system
4. **Demo** - Explore the widget library
5. **Native Demo** - Learn platform integration
6. **Kitchen Sink** - Study complex patterns and best practices

## Building All Examples

To verify all examples build correctly:

```bash
cargo build --examples --release
```

To check the entire workspace:

```bash
cargo check --workspace
```

## Development Tips

### Performance

- Always use `--release` for better performance when testing UI
- Development builds are much slower but compile faster
- Use `cargo build --examples` to build all examples at once

### Debugging

- Set `RUST_LOG=debug` for detailed logging:
  ```bash
  RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -p <example-name>
  ```

- Use `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for stack traces on panics:
  ```bash
  RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run -p <example-name>
  ```

### Platform-Specific Notes

**macOS:**
- Native widgets require macOS 10.15+
- Metal backend is used for rendering

**Windows:**
- DirectX 12 backend is preferred
- Fallback to DirectX 11 if DX12 unavailable

**Linux:**
- Vulkan backend is used
- GTK3+ required for native widgets

## Contributing

When adding new examples:

1. Create a new directory in `examples/`
2. Add a `Cargo.toml` with appropriate dependencies
3. Add a `src/main.rs` with your example
4. Update this README with a description
5. Ensure it builds with `cargo build --examples`
6. Test on all supported platforms if possible

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors

If you encounter build errors:

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
cargo clean
cargo build --examples

# Update dependencies
cargo update
```

### Runtime Issues

- Ensure your graphics drivers are up to date
- Check that your platform supports the required graphics APIs
- Verify native widget dependencies are installed (Linux)

### Platform-Specific Issues

**Linux:**
```bash
# Install required dependencies
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install gtk3-devel        # Fedora
```

**macOS:**
- Ensure Xcode Command Line Tools are installed:
  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```

**Windows:**
- Ensure Visual Studio Build Tools are installed
- Windows SDK is required
